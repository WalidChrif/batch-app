# Spring Batch Application

## Overview

This Spring Batch application is designed to process large volumes of data by reading from a source, performing transformations, and writing the output to a target. It leverages the robust Spring Batch framework, which provides reusable functions that handle tasks like data chunking, error handling, and transaction management.

## Features

- **Batch Job Processing**: Easily configurable jobs to process large datasets.
- **Chunk-based Processing**: Reads, processes, and writes data in chunks for efficient memory usage.
- **Transaction Management**: Ensures data integrity during job execution.
- **Retry/Skip Mechanism**: Built-in support for error handling with retries and skipping records (explained below).
- **Spring Web Integration**: Exposes APIs to trigger batch jobs via HTTP requests.
- **Job Monitoring**: Provides job monitoring via Spring Batchâ€™s JobRepository and JobExplorer.

## Technologies

- **Spring Batch**: Core framework for batch processing.
- **Spring Boot**: Used to create a standalone Spring application.
- **Spring Data JPA**: To interact with databases.
- **Spring Web**: Exposes REST endpoints for triggering batch jobs.
- **MySQL**: Used as the main database for storing batch job metadata and processing data.
- **Maven**: Build and dependency management tool.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17+ (or any version compatible with your Spring Boot version)
- Spring Boot 3.3.x (or compatible version)
- MySQL or any other database for job repository (ensure the correct driver is in your `pom.xml`)
- Maven installed on your system
